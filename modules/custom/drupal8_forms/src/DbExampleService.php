 * This repository is a service named 'drupal8_forms.drupal8_forms'. You can see
 * how the service is defined in drupal8_forms/drupal8_forms.services.yml.
 *
 * For projects where there are many specialized queries, it can be useful to
 * group them into 'repositories' of queries. We can also architect this
 * repository to be a service, so that it gathers the database connections it
 * needs. This way other classes which use the repository don't need to concern
 * themselves with database connections, only with business logic.
 *
 * This repository demonstrates basic CRUD behaviors, and also has an advanced
 * query which performs a join with the user table.
